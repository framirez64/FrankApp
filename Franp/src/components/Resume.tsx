This experience allowed me to work in-depth with cutting-edge open-source language models and understand them at a foundational level. I was able to benchmark models including but not limited to; Meta's LLAMA2/3 series of models, DeepSeek, MistralAI, and even was able to utilize OpenAI's GPT API endpoints. Beyond working with language models and integrating them into functioning applications, I'm well versed in utilizing Jupyter Notebooks and typical AI libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and CUDA. Additionally, I have a solid grasp of Answer Set Programming, a declarative programming approach meant to develop robust modeling and reasoning systems for AI agents.",
